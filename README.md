# Final Project

- To ensure that only authorized people enter, the user must log in first.
- The session is used so that when the user forgets to log out, it will be logged out automatically within the time set by the user himself through the rules.
- Users can see Live updates, so if the user has just added, deleted, and edited then the user will see the changes right away.
- Users can edit data that has errors after the data is input.
- Users can delete unwanted data.
- The number of books can be added and subtracted via the operation button, but if the user wants to control a very large number of books, we recommend using edit to save more time.
- If the login password that we provide is very unfamiliar to the user, the user can change it through the settings to prevent forgetting the password
- When on the dashboard home page the user can see all the data in the library system, but it is very long and a waste of time if you have to scroll one by one, so we created a shortcut that sneaks in as an icon in the total number section which is at the very top of the home page
